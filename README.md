# RoadMap for becoming a QuantAnalyst

- Kind of a todo application.
- Only current task and all previous tasks is shown.
- If completed button is clicked for current task, new task will appear.

- 365 Days - 365 tasks
- Let's take one step at a time

- If you want to use the same application and you have any other roadmap then fork my repo or clone my repo and update the plan.js file with your plan
- And ofcourse before running the application do install all the packages
- Use npm install command to install all the packages
